# Online Resume

This project was done as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

This application used jQuery to read the resume data from a JSON file (js/resumeBuilder.js), and then dynamically modifies the DOM to display the information.

###How to run the application

Open index.html. The resume will be displayed. 

The resume has six different sections: 

1. A header with my name, picture, contact information and skills
2. Work Experience
3. Projects
4. Education
5. An interactive map (including places where I have lived and worked)
6. Contact information at the bottom.
